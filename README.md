### CodeQuest

**Overview**  
CodeQuest is an interactive chatbot application that lets users engage with their codebase using Google Gemini. Developed with Streamlit, it provides an intuitive chat interface for querying and exploring code.

**Features**  
- **GitHub Integration**: Users can input their Google Gemini API key and the name of their GitHub repository. The repository is then cloned, segmented, and embedded for interactive use.
- **Chat Interface**: Utilizing Langchain, the application builds a QA retriever, allowing users to ask natural language questions about their codebase.
- **User Interaction**: Engage with the codebase through the chat interface, receiving responses based on the content of the code.

**Usage**  
1. **Clone the Repository**:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/example/repository.git
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies**:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Configure Environment Variables**:  
   - Add your Google Gemini API Key to the `.env` file.
   - Obtain and set your Deeplake API key.
4. **Run the Streamlit App**:  
   ```bash
   streamlit run chatbot.py
   ```
5. **Access the Chat Interface**: Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501). Enter your Google Gemini key and GitHub repository name to start interacting with your codebase.

**Limitations**  
- **Performance**: Large or intricate codebases may take longer to process.
- **Accuracy**: The quality of responses is influenced by the capabilities of Google Gemini and the code embeddings.

**Future Improvements**  
- **Advanced Integration**: Incorporate additional tools for more comprehensive codebase analysis.
- **Feature Expansion**: Enhance functionalities based on user feedback and new requirements.
